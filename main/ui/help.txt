  "[drill] Resources"
  {
    "Building a structure requires build points, which are now a one-time "
    "payment – if the buildable gets destroyed, the build points spent on it "
    "are lost.\n"
    "\n"
    "Your team will start with a small pool of build points but more can be "
    "acquired by building a mining structure.\n"
    "\n"
    "Read »Resource generation« for more."
  }
  "[leech] Resource generation"
  {
    "Build points are acquired via two structures – the human [drill] drill and"
    " the alien [leech] leech. These buildings need to be spread out for "
    "efficiency.\n"
    "\n"
    "Builders will see another bar above the health bar of a resource generator"
    " which represents its efficiency. A prediction will be shown when you "
    "position the buildable.\n"
    "\n"
    "The mine rate decreases over time, so that it gets increasingly harder to"
    " acquire resources in a long lasting match. This replaces sudden death.\n"
  }
  "[bsuit] Stages & Confidence"
  {
    "Building and destroying structures as well as killing enemies earns your "
    "team a new resource called ^2confidence^7. If you gain enough confidence "
    "new weapons, strucures or classes will be unlocked.\n"
    "\n"
    "Confidence decreases exponentially over time so if you idle your team will "
	"lose access to new items. Existing upgrades will remain functional.\n"
  }
  "[ckit] Human building ^21^7"
  {
    "The [reactor] reactor now supplies power to every point on the map, but "
    "there is a limited amount of energy per region. Human buildables will "
    "compete for power and shut down if they don't get enough.\n"
    "\n"
    "Human builders will see a new bar below the health bar of their "
    "buildables, which shows the spare power a buildable can share with "
    "potential neighbors.\n"
    "\n"
    "If you want to place a greater number of buildables in an area, you can "
    "build a [repeater] repeater to increase the available power. "
    "Be warned that repeaters will deal significant damage to close structures "
    "when they explode."
  }
  "[ckit] Human building ^22^7"
  {
    "When the power consumption in a region is too high, the smallest possible "
    "number of buildables will power down so that the other strucutres have "
    "enough energy to remain operational.\n"
    "\n"
    "The [drill] drill is the only buildable that requires a close repeater or "
    "reactor to work, since resources are transmitted via the power grid.\n"
    "\n"
    "The [basilisk] basilisk consumes power, too, so it can shut down "
    "buildables by its presence. Improve the power supply with repeaters to "
    "prevent this."
  }
  "[flamer] Wildfire"
  {
    "Alien buildables can catch fire when they are hit with the [flamer] flame "
    "thrower or the [grenade] firebomb.\n"
    "\n"
    "If structures are built too close, the fire can jump over to the "
    "unfortunate neighbors.\n"
    "\n"
    "A small fire has a good chance to go out after a while but a group of "
    "burning structures will keep itself hot enough for greater mayhem.\n"
    "\n"
    "The [advgranger] advanced granger's spit attack can be used to put out "
    "fires."
  }
  "[dretch] Advanced dretch"
  {
    "The [dretch] advanced dretch has a pounce ability. A pounce can be "
	"started with ATTACK2.\n"
    "\n"
    "After the pounce a cooldown period will set in. The cooldown is different "
    "for forward, sidewards/backwards and off-wall pounces.\n"
    "\n"
    "When moving forward or standing still, flat angles will result in greater "
    "speed, so the pounce can be used to quickly get to the head of distant "
    "enemies but it isn't well suited for getting high up. When strafing or "
    "moving backwards, the dretch will dodge. When pouncing off a wall, it will "
    "attempt to go to the surface you are aiming at."
  }
  "[dev] Miscellaneous"
  {
    "The human dodge has been removed, stamina has been increased.\n"
    "\n"
    "The grenade price has been increased (200 → 300).\n"
    "\n"
    "All alien evo costs and gains have been doubled. The new maximum of evos "
    "an alien can store is 20 (formerly 9)."
